As you can see from the picture, the third cub is much smaller compared to the other two siblings. Mortality is high during the cubs’ first year of life, but I like to think he made it.Follow me, @daisygilardini, for more images and behind-the-scenes stories. #WapuskNationalPark #polarbear #bear","'polarbear', 'bear', 'WapuskNationalPark'",1562040359,1,0,142113.7921,432.5742574,32200000,84,11000

And it felt surprising to see ramen, bibimbap and poke spots! And there are a ton of tour groups now, but considering how much work I�ve been doing for Emilia-Romagna tourism since 2011, more tour groups just means I�ve done my job! ???? Colson Whitehead once said that you become a New Yorker when the New York you love starts disappearing amidst the new developments. It�s just a testament to how much you love the city. And Bologna is freaking amazing!!! I�m so happy to be here amongst the sunshine, the red walls, the 11 AM Lambrusco breaks, and the squacquerone cheese.
