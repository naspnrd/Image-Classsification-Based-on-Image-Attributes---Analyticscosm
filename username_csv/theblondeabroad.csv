••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Fun fact: Ireland’s “Wild Atlantic Way” is the world’s longest coastal road trip! While we didn’t have time to do the entire length of the country, as it would take weeks, we slowly explored the southern coast and stumbled upon countless beaches, tiny villages, and, often times, more sheep than people. Even in the summer months, when tourism is at its peak, there are still parts of this country where you can feel completely alone with nature. It’s truly something special. ☘️

I was warned about the crazy weather in Ireland and that it’s often so rainy and windy it makes sightseeing nearly impossible. So, I’m feeling the “luck of the Irish” in a big way with so much sunshine on our trip. We’ve had relatively no wind and mostly clear sunny days — my farmer’s tan is now undeniable. Aside from weather like hen’s teeth (did I say that right? lol), the views in the south of Ireland have blown my mind (and so has the crazy driving)! We’ve driven on two-way roads (barely wide enough for one car) winding through massive farm lands, densely forested areas, and jagged and dramatic coastlines.

We visited Mizen Head, the most southwesterly point of Ireland, and I have to say I thought it was even more breathtaking than the Cliffs of Moher (with WAY less tourists)!

I recently returned from a solo trip to #Egypt and have SO much to say about it (I’ll do my best to break it up over the next few days lol)! I’ll be honest, I’d been holding off on traveling to Egypt for YEARS. A big part of that had to do with the stories I’d heard of women having negative experiences there. There’s no wrong or right way to travel—that’s for sure. And one person’s experience doesn’t automatically mean that it’s going to be the same for someone else. Good or bad. I appreciate honest accounts of travel experiences, because it helps me understand when I really need to do my research and decide if it’s the right destination for me or not. Some destinations I feel totally comfortable traveling to on a whim without doing an ounce of research. But, even with so much confidence in myself traveling on my own, there are still some places I research tirelessly, and make plans to ensure my safety. This was one of those places. I’m so happy that I had such a positive experience, met so many insanely friendly locals (a total stranger literally handed me their baby), and got to live out my lifelong dream of seeing the creations of Ancient Egyptians with my own two eyes.

In all honestly, I didn’t really start getting into “travel hacking” and points travel until a few years ago. However, it’s completely changed the way I see the world!

I’m able to upgrade my flights and book hotel stays entirely on points. I’ve racked up nearly 1,000,000 points simply by being strategic about the credit cards I use for business expenses and everyday purchases. 
Using a credit card is an important step in building a strong credit history and score, so why not earn travel rewards while paying for things like groceries and gas?

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
For seven years, I’ve been sharing on this platform, encouraging others to get out and see the world. However, this #EarthDay, I am struggling to limit my message to “let’s take better care of our planet” when I’m well aware of the contradiction that is my life. Sure, I “refuse the straw,” haven’t eaten meat in over 10 years, carry a re-usable water bottle and shopping bags, and try to live as green as I can. But, how can I sit here and encourage people to explore our world when the issue of air travel is that, on an individual level, it accounts for more carbon emissions than any other human activity? I have to take accountability for my actions and the real issues of an “extreme” travel lifestyle. I have flown nearly 1,000,000 air miles in my lifetime. I can’t even do the math on the impact that has had on our environment. A few years ago, I was flying nearly every week for a YEAR. Instagram is an easy place to glamorize this lifestyle and I would be a hypocrite in not admitting that I’ve played a big role in contributing to it. Posting pretty pictures of exotic destinations and saying how much I love our planet is one thing. But then opting to jump on 10 flights a month is a very different reality. Actionable change to reduce your emissions by traveling smarter is the only way to truly decrease your carbon footprint as a traveler. While I can’t promise that I’ll never take another flight, I feel that accountability is the first step in becoming a more conscious traveler. Last year, I proactively cut my flying from the previous year in half, and I am committed to continuing to fly less and more consciously for years to come. I put together a blog post on how I'm flying less this year, and how I'm pledging to offset my carbon footprint for EVERY flight I take. This isn’t for praise, but rather, to share the knowledge I’ve acquired through countless hours of research so that we can all become better travelers, and to help support causes that make a difference like reforestation and ocean conservation.

I was taking my parents across the country, showing them some of the highlights of this beautiful place I’ve been calling home for over 2 years.
 My dad had been dreaming of visiting Jeffrey’s Bay since he was a kid. He grew up in Southern California, part of the “Endless Summer” generation forever chasing the perfect wave. Our road trip soundtrack of classic rock — Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones — played on repeat as we drove through landscapes of mountain passes, massive canyons, epic coastlines, and finally ending in J Bay.

It’s an amazing feeling to give your parents some of their “firsts.” I think that’s one of the craziest parts of adulthood — realizing that you can eventually teach your parents things.

In case you missed it, my dad had to get his passport for this trip and this was his first time out of the US in 50 years. It took me TEN YEARS to finally get him on a plane.

The trip was amazing, but not without some serious hiccups. On day 2 of our road trip, while we were cycling around the beautiful Knysna lagoon, my mom fell and broke her collarbone.

Despite months of planning so that their trip would be perfect, it felt like everything was falling apart. I was dreading for my dad to say something along the lines of “I knew we shouldn’t have come.” But, those words never came. Low and behold, we finished our entire road trip, my mom bandaged up like a bird fallen from the nest. (The good news is she was out of pain in a few days and she’s having her surgery here with one of the best surgeons in South Africa.) We reached the southernmost tip of Africa, felt the chill of the Indian Ocean, tried new foods, and drove on the left side of the road. And, we watched the sun rise in the east and the sun set in the west in the same day.  This may seem like just another pretty beach sunrise photo on IG. But, on this morning, my dad said to me, “I finally understand why you travel.” And perhaps that’s why it’s one of the most significant photos I’ve ever posted. x",[],1554215697

I realize I haven’t posted many updates since I adopted Luna. For those of you that missed it, I bought a 2013 Land Rover Defender here in Cape Town. She’s my absolute dream machine.

I can officially say that I am now a manual driver and can drive stick shift with my “left” hand, from the “right” side of the car, and on the “left” side of the road. If you have ever been intimidated by learning to drive manual, try learning it backwards. #confuzzlingAF
•
A little background— Land Rover stopped producing the Defender in 2016, and they’re not allowed in the USA unless they’re 25 years old or older. And, even then, they’re ridiculously expensive. Needless to say, I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d get one. In South Africa. Where I’d be living. WHAT IS LIFE?!
•
Real talk, I sold my first car in California last year. A 2000 Toyota Celica. That I bought from the money I earned working at Papa Johns Pizza in high school. It became a running joke with my friends that (despite what you see on IG) I still drove my little old car until I was nearly 30. Priorities, right?! ✈️ > 🚙

Travel isn't always kind to my hair—especially in tropical destinations with lots of sun, sand, and saltwater! I started traveling with @Pantene's new Intense Rescue Shots (which are imported from Brazil and are available now at Pantene.com) to keep my hair healthy.

Unlike other hair treatments, these shots provide deep conditioning, Pro-Vitamin B5, strengthening lipids and natural glycerin that targets the damaged areas in just 30 seconds, and rinses out quickly in 30 seconds to avoid weighed-down hair. Plus, their travel-friendly size means I can bring them on any trip—even in a carry-on! Check my LINK IN BIO for more info.

It’s amazing how much can happen in 24 hours. Yesterday was a perfect summer day in Cape Town, but today felt like the apocalypse. Earlier today, Lion’s Head mountain, one of the local natural landmarks, caught fire. Anyone that’s visited Cape Town knows just how hectic the winds can get and, with a wildfire, there’s no worse combination. The fire spread over to the edge of our neighborhood in a few short hours and the air is still thick with smoke and the sound of the wind is deafening. We’ve gotten an update that the local firefighters will be working through the night. Thankful for their courage and for keeping us safe 🙏 I’ve posted a couple clips in my stories with more info on the situation.

I’ve never really opened up about it even though I have thought about her nearly every day since I got the news.

I carry a burden that evolves from anger, to guilt, to sorrow. It pops up when I don’t always expect it, but especially around the holidays and when I write or talk about destinations we traveled together.

One of the proudest things in my life is working together with her to raise over $5,500 for an orphanage in Peru. We traveled to Cusco to spend Christmas Day with the girls, then spent 4 days trekking the Inca Trail.

From the outside in, she had achieved so much in just 28 years. Working beside corporate bigwigs, traveling the world, and supporting charitable causes. When she passed, it came as a huge shock to everyone around her.

While I may never know her “why?” something I’ve learned is that, often times, the happiest people carry the most demons— and that’s what makes social media hard to swallow sometimes.

Despite what you see in media and online, life isn’t easy 100% of the time for ANYONE. You can’t assume that anything online is the ultimate truth. IG is the highlight reel of our lives.

So, if anyone on IG ever makes you feel less of yourself, PLEASE unfollow them, or at the very least, mute them. This platform should be uplifting and inspiring—so choose who you let in carefully.

If you find yourself putting on a happy face to stay strong for those around you, it’s important to give yourself a break. It’s ok to be vulnerable. Open up to someone about your pain— you are not a burden for asking for help.

So many of our challenges and disappointments in life are completely out of our control. There will always be hard times but there will also always be hope— we just have to choose to see it and pursue it relentlessly. Especially when it’s hardest to see.

As a travel blogger, I feel an obligation to demystify my lifestyle. You won’t resolve your insecurities by painting a picture of a perfect life. Happiness also isn’t found in faraway destinations. It’s got to be nourished and harvested within ourselves first—  the rest is just icing on the cake :)",[],1546461227

I’ve never been shy about my love for Harry Potter, so you can imagine my excitement yesterday at @UniStudios #WizardingWorldHollywood!

I’ve always had my nose in books. Before I physically traveled, reading was my way to discover the world. I also grew up with HP, so getting to see my childhood imagination in the physical world was such an amazing experience! I got to wander Hogsmeade Village with my family and even had my parents excitedly practicing magic spells with a wand.

At lunch at the Three Broomsticks, my 3 year old niece (who’s still a bit too young for the HP series), looked up at me with wide eyes and exclaimed, “CAN YOU HEAR THE MAGIC?” *I had to choke back tears*

While I know not everyone jumps at the chance to throw on a cape and pretend they’re a wizard, I will say that my imagination has brought me not only joy, but strength and success. It helps me tap into the realm of “anything is possible.” We all know the expression “don’t grow up,” which is I think a bit unrealistic. Life comes with responsibility, obligations and countless hurdles. So instead, I hope you never grow out of your imagination <3

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
I’ve admittedly been a bit disconnected mentally and physically from IG for the past few weeks. Like clockwork, this “constipation” kicks in every year towards year end. I physically can’t bring myself to pick up a camera, let alone pose for one. I feel like I have nothing interesting to say and simply don’t have the energy to create or share. • I started to realize that mayyybe sharing 5 blog posts weekly, daily IG stories, weekly YouTube videos, daily IG posts, and daily Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest posts would reduce my normally overflowing jar of creativity to crumbs. (Guess that’s not all that surprising, is it?)
•
When I come home between trips, I nurture my mental and physical health by slowing down, developing a routine, and binge watching mindless TV. I have to balance my highly-overstimulating lifestyle with simple pleasures. • Just like my mental and physical health, I’ve found that I also need to nurture my creativity. When I’m feeling creator’s block, I distance myself from my normal routine. I stop posting. I stop sharing. I stop shooting. I start reading. I start baking. I learn a new skill. I seek anything creative that is totally unrelated to what I ‘normally’ do. (I even started a “Home Sweet Africa” cross-stitch set lol!)
•
Einstein called this act “combinatory play” — opening one mental channel by dabbling in another. When creativity is your job, the stakes are high. You can’t always be creative just for the fun of it. You have to post daily, ‘beat the algorithm’ and deliver ‘epic’ content constantly. By exploring new creative outlets, it keeps my inspiration in motion, but relieves me of the pressure I put on myself. I spend my time trying things that are OK for me to NOT be good at, and I start to slowly refill my creative jar. • In true “Instagram inspiration” form, I shared this nugget of self-awareness on a pretty picture that’s completely unrelated to the message. But, I hope that because of it, some of you relate to it and seek out that soul nourishing creative break you also need. • More pretty pictures soon! Promise",[],1541530536

It might sound weird, but I often prefer to photograph myself. I still get camera shy if someone is shooting me. And, I am a photographer at heart. So it’s a fun challenge to be creative with how I shoot. For photos like this, I set up my tripod and put my camera on an interval timer setting to take a photo every second for 50 photos and then pick my favorite from the batch. I am able to get my composition and lighting right before pressing the shutter and jumping into frame. I probably look like a crazy tourist but it feels more natural for me and I end up looking way more comfortable in photos.

A few quick tips for self-shooting:
1. Don’t be embarrassed. They’re your memories and you can’t expect someone to always be there to capture them for you.
2. Read up on the rule of 3rds. It’s not the end-all-be-all of composition, but it’s a good guideline to work from (you’ll understand why I was so satisfied with my lines in this shot— thanks 🐦!)
3. Don’t skip the edit. I shoot in RAW (it gives more flexibility with your post-processing) and use my Lightroom @tbapresets for desktop and mobile!

That summer, I spent 3 months traveling through Australia, Southeast Asia and New Zealand, and went on my first big solo adventure to Thailand. I kept a daily online journal that would eventually become “The Blonde Abroad” — so, needless to say, that trip changed the course of my life forever and I’ve got a very special place in my heart for this country.

I’ll be spending the next week here, so grab your budgie smugglers, pour yourself a cuppa and tune into my IG stories for updates every arvo!

My last supper in California! It’s time to return to Cape Town after an amazing summer back in the northern hemisphere. I’ve been soaking up my final moments with friends and family here and, honestly, feeling really overwhelmed with emotion. It’s hard to leave little pieces of your heart all over the world. I can’t wait to get back to @meyerofcapetown after 10 weeks apart (long-distance relationships 😭), but I’ll be missing my loved ones here. I’ve been navigating the headspace between the “home” you were raised and the “home” you choose. Let’s call it, the long-term travel pickle. lol. I’ll be spending the next week in Texas, then it’s back “home” to South Africa! 🇿🇦 ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

This time three years ago, I took my first trip to China. My friend @tysontravel and I explored the Shaanxi region where we visited the Terracotta Army in Xian and hiked the ”world’s deadliest trail” at Mt Huashan. We also timed our trip to experience the #MidAutumnFestival, one of the most important Chinese festivals, where we celebrated under a full moon and ate our weight in delicious mooncakes (a type of pastry with a golden crust typically filled with red bean or lotus paste). For anyone planning to travel to China, I’ve compiled a list of my top tips for your first trip to the region along with a video that Tyson and I filmed.

The first thing I was told upon arriving to my first Burn back in 2013 was “Welcome Home.” An older man in nothing but a tutu immediately ran up, gave me a huge hug like we were long lost friends, and then told me to roll around in the dust. I won’t lie, the experience was completely jarring. I immediately thought, “What the hell did I just sign up for?!” I always thought I was an open minded person, but was this going to be totally beyond what I could handle? That week was one of the most uncomfortable, awe-inspiring, emotional, carefree, and life-changing experiences in my life. 5 Burns later, I’m proud to say that not much has changed. It still takes me at least 24 hours to shake the real world off, to stop thinking the word “weird” and to, if I’m being completely honest, stop judging. We all judge others based on what’s beautiful, what’s acceptable, what’s “normal,” and what’s cool, when those beliefs might not even be what we really feel. It’s just what we’ve been conditioned to think. If there’s any takeaway from #BurningMan that I try to carry with me, it’s that we’re all weird. There is no normal. Life is weird. Love is weird. The internet is REALLY weird. So why not be silly? Why live in fear of being uncool? Wear the tutu, roll in the dust, cry when things are sad and dance when everyone’s watching. You only have one life. How do you wanna spend it?

I've taken a LOT of road trips, from Iceland to Namibia to California, and there are always some safety precautions I follow. Firstly, I always pack a first-aid kit with all the essentials, and then snacks are the next priority (obviously). Before my trip, I'll brush up on local road signs, check the weather report, and make sure to bring my cell phone charger in case of any emergencies. And, fun fact, I know how to change a tire!

I’m back from #BurningMan! My voice is gone, my heart is full and my faith in humanity is restored. I rode a hot pink speedboat through the desert that passed out ice cold coconuts via a remote control island, listened to a “TEDesque Talk” on artificial reef systems that are helping to restore our oceans, and danced, played & laughed my way through one of the most extreme environments on Earth. I’m so grateful for getting to share so many memories with so many awesome humans. Thank you to every single person that contributes to this experience each year through art, gifting, camps, and music. You put in countless hours to create a city for strangers and your passion and love are felt long after we have left.
